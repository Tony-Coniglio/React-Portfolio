            My name is Tony Coniglio. I was born and raised in Austin, Texas. I have a BA in History from St. Edward's
            university in Austin, Texas, and a MA in History from Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. I worked
            for 10 years in the petro-chemical industry
            specifically in print-grade films and polymers. While working in polymers I held positions ranging from
            intern and janitor to sales, procurement, and logistics.

            I have also worked in interior design, with a specific focus on logistics and white-glove services. During
            my time in interior design I founded and grew an in-house white-glove moving and delivery service as a new
            entity/sister company.
