# React-Portfolio

## Overview

In this challenge I have attempted to create a personal portfolio using React. The portfolio contains information about myself, some of my past projects, and a contact page. The purpose of the portfolio is to eventual act as a tool to aid in the process of finding employment.

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

## Technologies Used

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bulma

## Future Developement

Due to time constraints much of the portfolio is unfinished. The primary focus for future developement will include fixing all CSS/formating issues, adding a Resume section, and polishing the layout.
